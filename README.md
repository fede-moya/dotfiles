### What is this for ?
This repository serves as the documentation for all the setup that I use for all of my software engeenering activities. 

### IDE (Text Editor)

#### Vim
The configuration is under the `vim` folder

#### Terminal
I use the iTerm2. No specific configuration for the terminal currently using defualt themes an default configuration settings. 

### Shell
I use ZSH. Configuration for the ZSH shell can be found under the `zsh` folder. 

### File browsing

As a complement for file browsing I like using the old `tree` command. Which in mac you can easily install entering:

```
brew install tree
```
